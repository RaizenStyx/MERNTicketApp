# Support Ticket MERN app

## Was hosted, but did not have enough traffic to keep active. Here is the code for my MERN app.

## Usage

Can set tickets that only you can see.

## Todo

- Set up an admin profile to oversee all tickets. 
- Add a priority field, low and high.
- Move the delete function for the admin to only use.
- Filter tickets on admin side to see top priority.
- Let admin change priority to 'Closed'.
